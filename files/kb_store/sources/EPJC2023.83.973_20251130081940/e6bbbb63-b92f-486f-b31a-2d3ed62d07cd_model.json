They are dominated by the single photon annihilation and can be evaluated reliably with timelike form factors. We utilize the quark-pair creation model, which is valid for the OZI suppressed decays, to evaluate the form factors. We obtain the branching fractions of \\(\\mathcal{B}(J / \\psi \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\overline{\\Sigma}^0 + c.c.) = (2.4 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{-5}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(2S) \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\overline{\\Sigma}^0 + c.c.) = (3.0 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-6}\\), which are compatible with the measurements by the BESIII collaborations, respectively. The decay asymmetries are found to be \\(\\alpha_{J / \\psi} = 0.314\\) and \\(\\alpha_{\\psi(2S)} = 0.461\\), which can be examined at BESIII in the foreseeable future."

In Table 1, we list the branching fractions \\((\\mathcal{B})\\) and decay asymmetries \\((\\alpha)\\) for \\(\\psi\\) decaying to a pair of octet baryon-antibaryons.

In this work, we adopt the quark pair creation model (QPC), also known as the \\( ^3 P_0 \\) model, to describe the quark-antiquark pair creation from the vacuum [27-30], which may originate from the gluon condensation [31]. The model has been widely used in the OZI-allowed hadronic decays [32-36]. By exploiting it in these OZI-suppressed modes, we provide a direct evaluation of the branching fractions and decay asymmetries of these isospin-violating channels. All of the decay modes considered in this work can be tested at BESIII."

However, the form factors cannot be evaluated even if the hadron wave functions are known. Besides the quark-antiquark pair produced by the photon, two additional pairs of quark-antiquarks are needed in order to form a baryon and an antibaryon. A possible way to calculate the creation matrix element of the baryon-antibaryon pair is to adopt the crossing symmetry on the hadron level [43]. Nevertheless, it is done by assuming the absence of a singularity in form factors. In this paper, we adopt the \\(^3 P_0\\) model to describe the creation of quark-antiquark pairs. By inserting the \\(^3 P_0\\) transition operator, the timelike form factors are directly evaluated. Details about this model and our approach can be found in the rest of this section."
