Our investigation centered on a generation-independent and leptophobic \\( Z' \\) with mass below 10 GeV. Given the present experimental conditions at Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) and the anticipated opportunities at the Super Tau Charm Factory (STCF), we conducted Monte-Carlo simulations to predict possible events at both facilities. Notably, we foresee a substantial enhancement in the precision of the lower limit estimation of \\( \\alpha_{\\mathrm{NP}} \\) as well as a reduction in statistical uncertainty with upcoming STCF experiments. Furthermore, it is essential to highlight that a null result in the measurement of \\( \\alpha_{\\mathrm{NP}} \\) would impose stringent constraints, requiring the \\( Z' - q - q \\) couplings to be in the order of \\( 10^{-2} \\)."

Searching for such a gauge boson helps us to gain more insight about the fundamental theory beyond the SM. Experimentally, direct searches for the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) boson are conducted in various types of high energy colliders, including \\(e^{+}e^{-}\\) colliders such as LEP, and hadron colliders such as Tevatron and LHC. Various mass ranges of \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) are scanned, and the couplings of \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) with both leptons and quarks are constrained. In the case of leptonic collider searches, the agreement between LEP-II measurements and SM predictions regarding the cross-section of \\(e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow f\\bar{f}\\) implies that either \\(M_{Z^{\\prime}} > 209\\) GeV or that the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) couplings with leptons are smaller than \\(10^{-2}\\) [18-20]. Stronger constraints have also been found through dark photon searches in various experiments [21-24]. The limit on the couplings between \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) and leptons is approximately \\(10^{-4}\\). Besides, some indirect searches through neutrino-electron scatterings are also proposed and severe constraints are established on various neutrino experiments [25, 26]."

Moreover, the future STCF is designed to take \\(1ab^{-1}\\) data, corresponding to \\(3.4 \\times 10^{12} J/\\psi\\) events per year [39], promising even higher precision in relevant processes. One of the \\(Z'\\) models has been proposed to relieve the tensions in the \\(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\) and \\(\\psi(2S) \\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\) branching fractions with fitted pion form factors [40]. In this study, we focused on parity violation in \\(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\overline{\\Sigma}^{0}\\) and its charge conjugate. Dominated by a single virtual photon exchange, the nonperturbative effects stemming from gluon exchanges in such decays are comparatively suppressed, allowing for a factorizable amplitude at the first order in theoretical calculations [41, 42]. Furthermore, the SM prediction for parity violation in \\(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\overline{\\Sigma}^{0} + c.c.\\) vanishes, leading to a clean background for the detection of \\(Z'\\). The BESIII collaboration has recently analyzed \\(CP\\) violation in \\(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\Lambda \\overline{\\Sigma}^{0}\\) [43]. They have measured the ratio between electric and magnetic form factors with high precision, demonstrating their capability to accurately reconstruct decay distributions. However, their study assumed spatial inverse parity symmetry, a constraint we have relaxed in our research, representing the main contribution of our study."

Our simulations indicate that these signals could be detected at BESIII, provided that the systematic uncertainty is further reduced. There is also potential for improved signal detection at the future STCF. If no clear signal emerges, we can still derive useful information by establishing general constraints on the couplings of the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) boson to quarks, typically falling within the range of \\(10^{-2}\\) to \\(10^{-1}\\), regardless of the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) mass. Our approach offers a competitive and complementary method for the detection of the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) boson with a mass below 10 GeV. Even in less favorable scenarios, valuable contributions are expected concerning the constraints on the couplings of the \\(Z^{\\prime}\\) boson to quarks in the low mass range."
